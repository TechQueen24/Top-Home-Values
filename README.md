# Top-Home-Values
## Project Summary
This is a personal project where I use the data from Zillow and BEA to identify where the top home values are in the U.S. by county and what the average income is for those counties.  
## Key Questions
* Where are the most desirable locations (provide top 10 counties) to own a home?
* What is average income in these top 10 counties?
* Are there any correlations?
* What does the future forecast predict for these top counties?

## Systems Used

* **Python:** Relational Database Management System used to store and query Rockbuster's data.
 * Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
 * NumPy: For numerical operations and array handling
 * OS: For interacting with the operating system, including file and directory operations
 * Matplotlib.pyplot: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations
 * Matplotlib.ticker.FuncFormatter: For custom formatting of axis ticks in plots
 * Seaborn: For statistical data visualization and creating informative, attractive graphics
